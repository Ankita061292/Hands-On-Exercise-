 Exercise 1
# 1. Install a package - data.table and give a name of function starting character "d"
install.packages("data.table")

# 2. Install and Load package -datasets. Use "women" data frame available in this package.
#    Find number of woman with height more than average but weight less than average
install.packages("datasets")
library("datasets")
women
mean.height<-mean(women$height)
mean.weight<-mean(women$weight)
women<-subset(women,height > mean.height & weight < mean.weight)
women
#nrow(women)

# 3. Create a data frame of 15 Indian cities and their population size. You could refer cities and
#population from this page.http://www.worldatlas.com/articles/thebiggest-cities-in-india.html

input_csv <- read.csv(file="C:/Users/Admin/Desktop/AMMA")
class(input_csv)

######OR######

#Load the required libraries
library("xml2")
library("rvest")

#Save URL in a variable
page_url = "http://www.worldatlas.com/articles/the-biggest-cities-in-india.html"

#Read the HTML data from the URL
my_file = read_html(page_url)

#Read the HTML node corresponding to all the tables in 'table' variable
table1 = html_nodes(my_file,"table")

#Get the required table in a separate variable
my_final <- html_table(table[1],fill=TRUE)

#View the table
View(my_final)
